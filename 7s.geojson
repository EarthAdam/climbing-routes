Now climb Capitol via the Knife Edge (NE Ridge), approaching from West Snowmass Creek (go 1.7 miles up the Snomass Creek Trail to the West Snowmass Creek fork on the right, which is signed; head up this trail a good three-four steep miles until you can contour along the east side of Mount Daly, near then at timberline, into the basin northeast of K2 that contains Moon Lake -- this is a good place to fill water bottles).\", '', \"From the summit of Capitol, descend SW along the knife-edge (loose, exposed) until you can downclimb due south into a bowl (some 5.7ish stuff, exposed). Continue south just west of the ridgeline on good, solid slabs, which lull you into thinking that the rest of the ridge will be bomber (it ain't). As soon as the slabs end, negotiate a series of gendarmes, invariably dropping west when the ridge itself either becomes too loose or impassable. This may involve 4th and 5th class downclimbing, depending on how far you drop off the ridge, and where. Continue this way for a long way, on terrain that is so sustained in its looseness as to be psychologically wearing. (I accidentally trundled some big stuff -- not onto myself -- it works best to keep your limbs as spread out as possible onto different blocks in case one goes. They all shift.) It also seemed best to stay right on the ridgeline when possible, as this places you atop all the choss.\", '', \"Along the way you'll pass various notches that allow you to bail east into the Pierre Lake Cirque, from which you could drop back down to Snowmass Creek, and your car.

Climb up diagonalling ramp/cracks to the right of the bowl on the north-facing wall (5.5, very exposed) to gain a faint rib. Follow dirt, loose blocks, etc. back to the ridge proper, then a nice pitch of solid rock (5.5/5.6; pass an old piton) on white stone takes you straight up the ridge to the summit of North Snowmass.\", '', 'The agony is over ... cruise over to the summit of Snowmass (3rd class), then descend via the East Face route to Snowmass Lake.

He let me lead the second rope,\" Neptune wrote in an email. \"There\\'s a photo in the store of our little group on the summit after that climb. Maybe that was the first ascent of the ridge. There were no pitons other than the ones Paul placed, and I didn\\'t remove any. I took a nice photo of the connecting ridge and thought that it might make a great traverse, but I never went back.\"', '', 'As for the FA of the integral ridge? Bill Forrest and Glen Denny set out, according to Forrest, with the goal to climb \"from the Outward Bound camp above Marble to the summit of South Maroon,  then climb Snowmass, then on to the summit of Capitol, and then return to  the O.B. camp - in less than 24 hours.\" Part of their monster day, then, was to traverse from Snowmass to Capitol and, says Forrest, \"we didn\\'t stay on the ridge all the  way when we traversed from Snowmass to Capitol. Staying on the \\'true ridge\\'  between Snowmass and Capitol was never part of the plan. We were pretty tired when we summited Snowmass. As I recall (and remember that was over 40 years ago), we were just below the ridge most of the way as we headed  west/northwest.  We had to gain the ridge to summit Capitol and  encountered a bit of 5th class as we climbed to the top of the ridge just S.  E. of Capitol\\'s summit.\"', '', \"So for now, I don't know who made the FA going from Capitol to Snowmass or how closely that hove to the ridgecrest itself. One section, to me, looked so loose as to be impassable, but you never know...\", '', 'Forrest and Denny\\'s accomplishment in 1966 is truly remarkable, a feat rarely if ever repeated, I\\'d imagine.

Not so; close upon the base and the climber will find a path of weaknesses leading through several small overhangs, and a much lower angle, broken upper face.
