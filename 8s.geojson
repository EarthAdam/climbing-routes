The [Gillett] guidebook suggests there are a number of options, supposedly from 5.6 - 5.8, but questionable rock and protection seemed to narrow the choices.  We chose to begin just left of and 50\\' up the ridge bottom, traversing right out on a good ledge to gain a finger crack that splits the broad face of the lower ridge.  There were two distinct cruxes on this variation.  The first is right off the good ledge up thin edges and smearing while placing good pro in the thin crack.  The second is easier technically, but a mind full psychologically.  After the edges and smearing, the crack approaches a small roof that is passed on the left to a good stance.  Above the stance, a smooth face must be negotiated.  This face is capped by another small roof and the best option seems to be to follow the very thin crack up a small left facing dihedral on the right, and escape right from under the roof above the dihedral.  Not terribly difficult climbing, but the pro leaves something to be desired. An ancient bolt (remnants of the first ascent party?) lies in the middle of the face and can be strung with a long sling, but the rust and loose manner of the hanger suggests this protection is more for show than usefulness.  RPs, the smallest stoppers you have (and maybe a stick of gum) can be placed in the thin crack of the dihedral to back up this \"bolt.\"', '', 'Once you have a small nest of pro in the crack, charge up and step right above the dihedral, and climb a small bulge.

At the top of the headwall you will be standing on a flat summit plateau, the top of the Piz Buttress, but not the end of the climbing.
